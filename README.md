# Frontend Solution for Remote MongoDB Integration

This is my solution to a local frontend that pulls a JSON object from a remote cloud-based MongoDB (Atlas) server. We developed this for the 02 Team Assignment.

## How to Run

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Initialize npm:
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

2. Install CORS:
    ```bash
    npm install cors
    ```

3. Install MongoDB:
    ```bash
    npm install mongodb
    ```

That's it! You're ready to use the frontend solution for remote MongoDB integration.
